# FILM
Frame interpolation algorithm developed by Google Research. https://github.com/google-research/frame-interpolation

#Test/Use Case

Inputs are 2 different frames(hand signs) which FILM uses to produce an interpolated video between the signs

Conclusion:
-FILM performs well with interpolating facial expressions, but the hands kind of 'melt away'.
